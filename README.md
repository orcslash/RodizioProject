# RodizioProject

Mock restaurant booking system using JavaServer Faces and SQLite as a project for BAAA.

When running the program for the first time, the database tables are dropped and reinitialised with new dummy values. 

To prevent that comment out at least the Database call "addDummyValues();" from StaffBean constructor.

To access the StaffPage either run the staffPage from netbeans or go to RodizioProject/faces/StaffPage.xhtml url (which will redirect you to the login page) and login with username - "qq", password - "qq".
